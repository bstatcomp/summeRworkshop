# R and Rstudio
R (https://www.r-project.org/) is a free open-source software for statistical 
computing.
The basic interface to R is via console, which is quite rigid. RStudio 
(https://www.rstudio.com) provides
us with a better user interface and additional functionalities 
(R notebooks, RMarkdown,...). 

Usually the page in RStudio is separated into four parts.
Upper left part is used for scripts. These are R files (or similar) which
include our code and represent the main building blocks of our programs.
Lower left part is the console, equivalent to the basic console interface of
R. Upper right part is dedicated to the environment and history. Lower
right part shows our workspace, plots, packages, and help.

To create a new script, go to File -> New File -> R Script. To run the code,
highlight the desired part of the code and press Ctrl + Enter. Alternatively,
you can run the code by clicking the run icon in the top-right corner of
the script.

To specify the working directory, use `setwd()` function, where you
provide the working directory in parentheses. For example to set the
working directory to C:/Author you would call

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Author")
```

Note that R recognizes either a slash or double backslash in the path, 
but it does not recognize a single backslash, which is the default if you
copy the path on a Slovenian computer.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Author") # OK
setwd("C:\\Author") # OK
setwd("C:\Author") # Not OK.
```

# Variables

Variables are the main data type of every program. In R, we define the values
of variables with the syntax `<-`. We do not need to initialize the type of
the variables, as R predicts it. We denote strings with `""`. Comments
are written with `#`. 

Let's create some variables.

```{r, error=TRUE}
n            <- 20
x            <- 2.7
m            <- n # m gets value 20
my_flag      <- TRUE
student_name <- "Luka"
student_name <- Luka # because there is no variable Luka, it returns an error
```

By using the function `typeof()` we can check the type of a variable. 


```{r}
typeof(n)
typeof(student_name)
typeof(my_flag)
```

We can change the types of variables with as.type functions.
The main 
types are **integer**, **double**, **character** (strings), and **logical**.
Note that the type character is used for strings and we do not have a separate
type for single characters.

```{r, error=TRUE}
typeof(as.integer(n))
typeof(as.character(n))
```

Another common type is date. We can convert a character string to a date with
the `as.Date()` function. When using this function, we have to be careful to
provide the correct format of the date.

```{r, error=TRUE}
some_date <- as.Date("2019-01-01", format = "%Y-%m-%d")
some_date
```


To access the values of the variables, we use variable names.

```{r error=TRUE}
n
m
my_flag
student_name
```

We can apply arithmetic operations on numerical variables.

```{r}
n + x
n - x
diff <- n - x # variable diff gets the difference between n and x
diff
n * x
n / x
x^2
sqrt(x)
n > 2 * n # logical is greater
n == n # equals
n == 2 * n
n != n # not equals
```

We can concatenate strings with functions `paste()` and `paste0()`. The
difference between these functions is that the first one forces a space
between inputs, while the second one does not.

```{r}
paste(student_name, "is", n, "years old")
paste0(student_name, "is", n, "years old")
L_username <- paste0(student_name, n)
```

Function `paste()` can get an additional parameter `sep`, which should
be used between the inputs. If we want to find out more about a function, 
we put a question mark before the function's name in the console.

```{r}
# ?paste
paste(student_name, "is", n, "years_old", sep = "_")
```


# Basic data structures


## Vector


Vectors are the most common data structure in R. They consist of several
elements of the same type. We create them with the function `c()` (combine).


```{r}
student_ages  <- c(20, 23, 21)
student_names <- c("Luke", "Jen", "Mike")
passed        <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
```

To access individual elements of vectors we use square brackets with the
sequential number of the elements we want. 
**The indexing in R starts with 1**, as opposed to 0 (C++, Java,...).


```{r}
student_ages[2]
student_names[2]
passed[2]
```

To get the length of the vector use `length()`.


```{r}
length(student_names)
```

We can use element-wise arithmetic operations on vectors, and we can use
the scalar product (`%*%`). 
Note that you have to be careful with vector lengths. 
For example, if we have an operation on two elements---in our case vectors---and
they are not of the same length, the smaller one will start preiodically
repeating itself, until it reaches the size of the larger one. In that case,
R will provide us with a warning. 


```{r error = TRUE}
a <- c(1, 3, 5)
b <- c(2, 2, 1)
d <- c(6, 7)
a + b
a * b
a + d # not the same length, d becomes (6, 7, 6)
a + 2 * b
a %*% b # scalar product
a > b # logical relations between elements
b == a
```

We often want to select only specific elements of a vector. There are several
ways to do that---for example all of the calls below return the first two
elements of vector `a`.



```{r error = TRUE}
a[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)] # selection based on logical vector
a[c(1,2)] # selection based on indexes
a[a < 5] # selection based on logical condition
```

We can also use several conditions. If we want both conditions to hold, we use
and (`&`), if only one has to hold we use if (`|`). Note that only here we
use only a single 
symbol for each, as opposed to some other programming languages
that use two.

```{r error = TRUE}
a[a > 2 & a < 4]
a[a < 2 | a > 4]
```


## Factor

Factors can be considered more as a variable type, than a data structure.
But since they are based on vectors, we present them at this point.

Factors are used for coding categorical variables, which can only take
a finite number of predetermined values. We can further divide categorical
variables into nominal and ordinal. Nominal values don't have an ordering
(for example car brand), while ordinal variables do (for example 
frequency---never, rarely, sometimes, often, always). Ordinal variables
have an ordering but usually we can not assign values to them (for example
sometimes is more than rarely, but we do not know how much more).

In R we create factors with function `factor()`. When creating factors, we can
determine in advance, which values the factor can take with the argument
`levels`. If we wish to add a non-existing level to a factor variable, R
turns it into NA.

```{r error = TRUE}
car_brand <- factor(c("Audi", "BMW", "Mercedes", "BMW"), ordered = FALSE)
car_brand
freq      <- factor(x       = NA,
                    levels  = c("never","rarely","sometimes","often","always"),
                    ordered = TRUE)
freq[1:3] <- c("rarely", "sometimes", "rarely")
freq
freq[4]   <- "quite_often" # non-existing level, returns NA
freq
```



## Matrix
Two-dimensional generalizations of vectors are matrices. We create them
with the function `matrix()`, where we have to provide the values and either
the number of rows or columns. Additionally, the argument `byrow = TRUE` 
fills the matrix with provided elements by rows (default is by columns).

```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(c(1, 2, 1,
                      5, 4, 2),
                    nrow  = 2,
                    byrow = TRUE)
my_matrix
my_square_matrix <- matrix(c(1, 3,
                             2, 3),
                           nrow  = 2)
my_square_matrix
```

To access individual elements we use square brackets, where we divide the
dimensions by a comma.

```{r}
my_matrix[1,2] # first row, second column
my_matrix[2, ] # second row
my_matrix[ ,3] # third column
```

Some useful functions for matrices.


```{r}
nrow(my_matrix) # number of matrix rows
ncol(my_matrix) # number of matrix columns
dim(my_matrix) # matrix dimension
t(my_matrix) # transpose
diag(my_matrix) # the diagonal of the matrix as vector
diag(1, nrow = 3) # creates a diagonal matrix
det(my_square_matrix) # matrix determinant
```

We can also use arithmetic operations on matrices. Note that we have to be
careful with matrix dimensions. For matrix multiplication, we use `%*%`


```{r error = TRUE}
my_matrix + 2 * my_matrix
my_matrix * my_matrix # element-wise multiplication
my_matrix %*% t(my_matrix) # matrix multiplication
my_square_matrix %*% my_matrix
my_matrix %*% my_square_matrix # wrong dimensions
```

We can transform a matrix into a vector.

```{r error = TRUE}
my_vec <- as.vector(my_matrix)
my_vec
```



## Array
Multi-dimensional generalizations of matrices are arrays.

```{r}
my_array <- array(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), dim = c(2, 2, 2))
my_array[1, 1, 1]
my_array[2, 2, 1]
my_array[1, , ]
dim(my_array)
```


## Data frame

Data frames are the basic data structure used in R for data analysis. 
It has the form of a table, where columns represent individual variables, and
rows represent observations. They differ from matrices, as the columns can be
of different types. We access elements the same way as in matrices.

We can combine vectors into data frames with `data.frame()`. The
function transforms variables of type character into factors by default.
if we do not want that, we have to add an argument `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`. 
We can assign column names with the function `colnames()`. 


```{r}
student_data           <- data.frame(student_names, student_ages, passed,
                                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
colnames(student_data) <- c("Name", "Age", "Pass")
student_data
```


We can also assign column names directly, when creating a data frame.

```{r}
student_data <- data.frame("Name" = student_names, 
                           "Age"  = student_ages, 
                           "Pass" = passed)
student_data
```

Similar to vectors, we can access the elements in data frames (and matrices) 
with logical calls. Here we need to be careful if we are selecting rows or
columns. To access specific columns, we can also use the name of the column
preceded by `$`.


```{r}
student_data[ ,colnames(student_data) %in% c("Name", "Pass")]
student_data[student_data$Pass == TRUE, ]
student_data$Pass
```



## List

Lists are very useful data structure, especially when we are dealing with 
different data sets and data structures. We can imagine a list as a vector, 
where each element can be a different data structure. For example, a list can
have a vector stored on index 1, a matrix on index 2, and a data frame on
index 3. Moreover, a list can be an element of a list and so on.


```{r}
first_list  <- list(student_ages, my_matrix, student_data)
second_list <- list(student_ages, my_matrix, student_data, first_list)
```

We access the elements of a list with double square brackets.


```{r}
first_list[[1]]
second_list[[4]]
second_list[[4]][[1]] # first element of the fourth element of second_list
```

We can also apply `length()` to get the number of elements in the list.

```{r}
length(second_list)
```

To append to list, we use the call below.

```{r}
second_list[[length(second_list) + 1]] <- "add_me"
second_list[[length(second_list)]] # check, what is on the last index
```

Additionally, we can name the elements of the list, and access them by name.
For that we use the `names()` function.

```{r}
names(first_list) <- c("Age", "Matrix", "Data")
first_list$Age
```


# Packages

R is an open-source programming language and anyone can contribute to its
development. Many packages exist that make our work in R easier. 
Additionally, some packages include different
statistical models---some of which are implemented in other languages for
efficiency (for example C++). An open-source repository CRAN consists of most
packages that you are going to need. To install a specific package, we use
the function `install.packages()`, or we can use R-Studio's UI. Once a
package is installed, we can load it into our workspace with `library()`. 
We will get to know several useful packages during this workshop.


```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("stats") # install package
library(stats) # load the package into workspace
```



# Data import {#bpod}

We often encounter data in a csv (comma separated value) format. Different
pacakges in R allow us to read data from csv, txt, xlsx, etc. formats.
Here we will go through reading data from csv and xlsx formats.

To read csv data use `read.csv` from the
package `utils`. Before we read the data, we need to check two things.
First, what is the character that separates the columns and how the decimal
places are denoted (comma or dot). 
Second, if the data have a header (Does the first row contain column names?).
Function automatically returns a data frame. `read.csv()` assumes that
comma is the separator and a decimal point. However, it allows the
change of these default values by providing the corresponding arguments. It
also assumes that we have a header by default. When saving your data in the
CSV format, we recommend using a semi-colon as the separator, as comma is
often used a) in text, b) as the decimal separator, or c) as 
thousands separator.

In our **data** folder, we have medical insurance data set acquired from Kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/easonlai/sample-insurance-claim-prediction-dataset/). 
To show different reading functions, we saved the data set in three
different formats---csv with a comma separator, csv with a semi-colon
separator, and xlsx file. The file also contains a 
header. Function `head()` returns
the first six rows of the data frame.


```{r}
library(utils)
claim_data <- read.csv("./data/insurance01.csv")
head(claim_data)
```

The dot in the string represents current working directory. We see that
R automatically converted string variables (sex, smoker, region) to factors.
In our case this is sensible. However, sometimes we want strings to remain
strings. In those cases, change the argument `stringsAsFactors` to false.

Along with a semi-colon as the separator, the second file has
a decimal comma. Therefore

```{r eval = FALSE}
claim_data <- read.csv("./data/insurance02.csv", sep = ";", dec = ",")
```

Data is often saved as xlsx. To read data from xlsx, we use the `read.xlsx`
function from the package __xlsx__. 
However, this function can be quite slow, so if you are dealing with
large data frames, it might be better to save the excel file as a csv file
and then read it as csv.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(xlsx)
claim_data <- read.csv("./data/insurance03.xlsx")
```

# If statement
We often want to execute code based on some condition. For that we use
the `if`-`else` pair.

```{r}
x <- 5
if (x < 0) {
  print("x is smaller than 0")
} else if (x == 0) {
  print("x is 0")
} else {
  print("x is greater than 0")
}

```

# Loops
The most useful loop in R is the for loop. In the for loop we have to define
a new variable, which will represent the different iterations of the loop.
Then we have to define the values over which that variable will iterate. Often,
these are sequential numbers. For example, let us add first 10 natural numbers.

```{r}
my_sum <- 0
for (i in 1:10) { # 1:10 returns a vector of natural numbers between 1 and 10
  my_sum <- my_sum + i
}
my_sum
```

The values in a for loop do not have to be sequential numbers.

```{r}
my_sum       <- 0
some_numbers <- c(2, 3.5, 6, 100)
for (i in some_numbers) {
  my_sum <- my_sum + i
}
my_sum
```

For example, let us calculate the average charges per region on our data set.

```{r}
regions <- unique(claim_data$region) # returns unique values in region column
for (reg in regions) {
  tmp_data   <- claim_data[claim_data$region == reg, ]
  charges    <- tmp_data$charges
  print(paste0("Region: ", reg, 
               ", average charges: ", mean(charges)))
}
```



# Functions
Base R consists of several function intended for easier work with data, for
example `length()`, `dim()`, `colnames()`,... We can extend the set of functions
with packages. For example, package **stats** allows us to create statistical
models with the use of a single function---for example the linear model `lm()`.
Here we will present some useful functions, more complex functions will 
follow in later chapters. Remember, if you want additional information about
functions, we can call the name of the function in the console, where we
add a question mark (for example `?length`). 


```{r}
1:10 # special function that returns a sequence of numbers
sum(1:10) # sum of first 10 natural numbers
sum(c(3,5,6,3))
rep(1, times = 5) # returns a vector of lenght 5, where all values are 1
rep(c(1,2), times = 5) # returns a vector of length 5 where 1 and 2 are periodically changing
seq(0, 2, by = 0.5) # vector from 0 to 2, by adding 0.5
prod(1:10) # multiply first 10 numbers
round(5.24)
5^5 # square
sqrt(16) # square root
as.character(c(1,6,3)) # transforms a numerical vector to a character vector
```


We often want a summary of our data. We can get it with `summary()`. We
can use it on vectors and on data frames. The returned values are dependent
on the types of variables.


```{r}
summary(student_ages)
summary(student_names)
summary(passed)
summary(car_brand)
summary(freq)
summary(student_data) # summary of the whole data frame
```


## Writing functions
We can write our own functions with `function()`. In the brackets, we
define the parameters the function gets, and in curly brackets we define what
the function does. We use `return()` to return values.

```{r}
sum_first_n_elements <- function (n) {
  my_sum <- 0
  for (i in 1:n) {
    my_sum <- my_sum + i
  }
  return (my_sum)
}
sum_first_n_elements(10)
```

If we want that the function returns several different data structures,
we use a list. 
For example, let us look at a function which gets a matrix 
as input, and returns its transpose and determinant.


```{r}
get_transpose_and_det <- function (mat) {
  trans_mat <- t(mat)
  det_mat   <- det(mat)
  out       <- list("transposed"  = trans_mat,
                    "determinant" = det_mat)
  return (out)
}
mat_vals <- get_transpose_and_det(my_square_matrix)
mat_vals$transposed
mat_vals$determinant
```



## Other useful functions for data summarizing
There are several functions that are useful when working with data. We already
mentioned the `summary()` function. Let's look at some other functions.

To generate random numbers we can use a variety of random number generators.
Which we select depends on the data that we wish to generate. Usually, we
want to be able to replicate our analysis exactly, therefore we recommend the
use of a seed---this will generate the same random numbers everytime you
call the function. There is a function for that in R called `set.seed()`.

```{r}
set.seed(0)
norm_dat  <- rnorm(1000, 5, 6) # generate 1000 samples from the normal
                               # distribution with mean 5 and standard deviation 6
count_dat <- rpois(2000, 8) # generate 2000 samples from the Poisson
                            # distribution with mean 8
unif_dat  <- runif(1000, -2, 5) # generate 1000 samples from the uniform
                                # distribution form -2 to 5
```

In data science, we often work with statistics, so let's look at some functions
which provide us with meaningful information about our data.

```{r}
mean(norm_dat)
var(norm_dat) # variance
sd(norm_dat) # standard deviation
max(norm_dat)
min(norm_dat)
quantile(norm_dat) # calculates 5 quantiles of the data
```

We often want to standardize the data, before doing analysis. We can do that
manually, or we can use R's `scale()` function.

```{r}
st_dat <- scale(norm_dat)
mean(st_dat)
var(st_dat)
```


# Debugging
For the debugging in R we will use the `browser()` function. It stops the
execution of the code and you can access the variables in the environment at 
the moment that browser was called.

For browser commands see ?browser or type help when browser is active.


# Data wrangling with dplyr
Dplyr is a package for easier data manipulation. It is a part of a collection of
packages called **tidyverse**, which consist of several R packages intended for
data science. Dplyr is especially useful for data frame manipulation.

The main format of working with data in tidyverse is a **tibble**. This data
structure is very smilar to base R's data frame, however it is designed for
easier work with other packages in tidyverse and also provides a different
print output. Let's look at it on our football data set.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```
```{r}
claim_data <- read.csv("./data/insurance01.csv")
head(claim_data)

claim_data <- as_tibble(claim_data)
claim_data
```

A tibble only shows the first 10 rows of the data set for clarity. Additionally,
it only prints as many columns as fit into a page, and lists other columns
below. If we wish to see all of the tibble, we can use the function `View()`.
Under the variable names, a tibble shows the type of the variables. 

Now that we have our starting data set, we can begin manipulating it. This
usually consists of selecting specific rows and columns, and adding statistics
derived from variables in the data frame. Below we describe five functions
which will enable us dynamic data set manipulation.

## Filter
The function `filter()` allows us to select rows, based on values of the
variables. As input it gets a tibble and the conditions and it outputs a new
tibble that consists only of desired rows.

```{r warning=FALSE}
filter(claim_data, region == "southwest")
filter(claim_data, region == "southwest", age > 18)
```

The conditions in filter use and---all conditions have to be satisfied. If
we want to use or, we have to divide them with a pipe |.

```{r}
filter(claim_data, region == "southwest" | region == "northwest")
```

Or, the same can be achieved by using the operator %in%.

```{r}
filter(claim_data, region %in% c("southwest", "northwest"))
```

For example, let's say we are interested in doing further analysis on
people older than 18, who live in the south. We can construct a new tibble,
where we filter out the unnecessary rows.

```{r}
claim_df <- filter(claim_data, region %in% c("southwest", "southeast"), 
                   age > 18)
```

## Arrange
To arrange data we use dplyr's function `arrange()`, which gets a tibble and the
variables on which to arrange. If we want a descending arrangement, we have to 
use function `desc()`.

```{r}
arrange(claim_df, age)
arrange(claim_df, age, desc(charges))
```



## Select
In our current data set we have a relatively small number of columns, so 
working with our tibble is not too complicated. However, we often encounter
data sets with large numbers of columns. In such situations, we might want
to select a subset of columns. For that we have the function `select`.

To select certain columns, input the names into select.

```{r}
select(claim_df, age, sex)
```

We can also select all columns between two columns with a colon. Using a
minus sign will select all columns except the ones in the expression.

```{r}
select(claim_df, bmi:region)
select(claim_df, -(bmi:region))
```

There are several utility functions that let us select columns based on
their names, for example `ends_with`, `starts_with`, or `contains`.

```{r}
select(claim_df, starts_with("c"))
```



## Mutate
To create new variables in the data frame, dependent on the existing variables,
we can use the `mutate()` function. For example, let's create a new variable,
which will consist of charges per insured person.

```{r}
claim_df <- mutate(claim_df, charges_per_person = charges / (children + 1))
claim_df
```

We can also use own functions when creating new variables. 
For example, let us create a new variable, which will classify the
insured according to the standard BMI categories.

```{r}
classify_bmi <- function (bmi) {
  bmi_classes <- rep("underweight", times = length(bmi))
  bmi_classes[bmi >= 18.5 & bmi < 25] <- "normal"
  bmi_classes[bmi >= 25]              <- "overweight"
  bmi_classes <- factor(bmi_classes, levels = c("underweight", 
                                                "normal", 
                                                "overweight"),
                        ordered = TRUE)
  return(bmi_classes)
}
claim_df <- mutate(claim_df, bmi_class = classify_bmi(bmi))
claim_df
```
The tibble is too wide to show all variables. Let us use select to
check the values of our new variable.

```{r}
select(claim_df, bmi, bmi_class)
```


## Summarise
The `summarise` function aggregates the data according to some condition.
Conditions are provided with the function `group_by`, if they are not, 
the data are aggregated over the whole tibble.

```{r}
summarise(claim_df, mean_age = mean(age), mean_charges = mean(charges))
```

To get something more meaningful, we first need to group the data.
For example let us look at the mean charges, dependent on whether
the insured is a smoker and his BMI class.

```{r}
g_data <- group_by(claim_df, smoker, bmi_class)
summarise(g_data, mean_charges = mean(charges))
```




## The pipe
To arrive at the above results we made several changes to the original data
set. However, we can use the pipe `%>%` to do all these calls sequentially,
without
creating an additional data set, or changing the original.

Let us demonstrate how to get the same result as above with use of the pipe.

```{r}
claim_df %>%
  filter(age >= 18, region %in% c("southwest", "southeast")) %>%
  mutate(bmi_class = classify_bmi(bmi)) %>%
  group_by(smoker, bmi_class) %>%
  summarise(mean_charges = mean(charges))
```

To count the number of cases in each group, use `count()`.

```{r}
claim_df %>%
  filter(age >= 18, region %in% c("southwest", "southeast")) %>%
  mutate(bmi_class = classify_bmi(bmi)) %>%
  group_by(smoker, bmi_class) %>%
  count()
```
