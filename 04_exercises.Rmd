# R introduction and dplyr

## Exercise 1
Create vectors $x$ and $y$, where $x$ is a sequence of integers between 4 and 25 and $y$ is a sequence of the same length as $x$ from -5 to 2.

* Calculate the second powers of elements of $y$.
* Sum $x$ and $y$.
* Divide $x$ by $y$.
* Calculate the sum of the differences between $x$ and $y$.
* Select the elements of $x$, where the elements on the same position in $y$
  are positive.
* Calculate the scalar product of $x$ and $y$.


## Exercise 2
Create a data frame that includes at least 5 rows (observations). Additionally, the data frame should include at least one of each of the following variables:

* integer,
* numeric,
* date,
* character,
* nominal factor,
* ordinal factor.


## Exercise 3
Use the normal random number generator (tip: use seed) to create:

* 4x4 matrix $A$,
* 2x5 matrix $B$,
* 5x4 matrix $C$.

Calculate:

* the mean of values in $A$,
* the variance of values in $A$,
* the max value in all of the matrices,
* the sum of $A$ and its transpose,
* the element-wise product of $A$ and its transpose,
* the scalar product of $B$ and $C$,
* the determinant of $B^TB$.



## Exercise 4
Write a function that takes vector $x$ and iterates over its values. At each iteration the function prints whether $x$ is greater than 0,  lower than zero, or equal to zero. (see `?print`). Use the function by taking $x$---30 random numbers from a normal distribution with  mean 3 and variance 4.


## Exercise 5 (Fibonacci)
Write a function with parameter _n_, which outputs the first $n$ Fibonacci numbers. The $n$-th Fibonacci number is calculated as $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$, $F_0 = 0$, and $F_1 = 1$.


## Exercise 6 (Machine learning and data science jobs)
Read the `DSjobs.csv` data (source: https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017) and save it as a tibble. The observations in the data set are people who work in machine learning and data science jobs around the world, their information (nationality, gender, job title,...) and their compensation (wages). The data is based on a survey done by Kaggle.

Do the following tasks on the original data set:

* remove all columns starting with "Time",
* remove all rows where the the employment status is not full-time,
* adjust the compensation by the exchange rate (the compensation in the
  data set is currently in the currency of the country of the person),
* remove rows where the adjusted compensation is equal to NA (see `?is.na` ),
* calculate the mean and median adjusted compensation for each job title
  (Why do these statistics differ so much?) and arrange descending by the
  median,
* do all of the above using the pipe.


## Exercise 7 (NBA players)
Read the `player_wage.csv` data (source: https://www.kaggle.com/aishjun/nba-salaries-prediction-in-20172018-season#2017-18_NBA_salary) and save it as a tibble. The observations in the data set are NBA players, their information (statistics, nationality,...) and their wages. For a glossary of NBA terms, see  https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html.

Do the following tasks on the original data set:

* create a tibble with only Slovenian players,
* create a tibble with all USA players who play for Golden State Warriors (GWS),
* arrange Players first by age, then by salary, both descending
* create a tibble with columns name, country, draft number, age and team,
* add a new variable to the data frame, minutes per game (MPG),
* create a tibble with average salary per team descending,
* create a tibble with average salary per country descending,
* create a 
  tibble with players from the USA, summarise the salary per minutes
  played, grouped by team (use the pipe!).
  

# Basic data analysis and dynamic reports

## Exercise 1
Create a R Markdown report where you analyse temperatures in three countres -- Slovenia, Finland and Niger. In the first section of the report create two tables, one table shows the mean summer temperature for each country for each month separately. The second table is simlar, but insted of means it should show 95% confindence intervals.

In the second section use linear modelling (`lm`) to find out if temperature is rising through the ages. Run the analysis separately for each country and report your findings. Plot the three regression lines by using the `ggplot` library. Use the results to predict the temperature in year 2100.


## Exercise 2
Design a Shiny app which enables you to compare temperature in Slovenia, Finland and Niger. Add three control sliders -- one for the amount of bins in the histogram, one for determining the year interval and one for months interval. To plot temperatures use a single `ggplot` histogram graph, separate it into three sub-graphs with faceting.

If you feel adventurous you can design a different visualization (you can use different controls and a different type of graph).
