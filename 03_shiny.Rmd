#Shiny

Shiny (https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive visualizations or even web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript. Shiny is a very powerful framework, you can see some example of what you can create with it here: https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/.

Since Shiny apps have a specific structure it is by far the easiest way to start desigining one by using the `New Project...` option in the `File` menu of RStudio. Next you have to select whether you want to put the new R project into an existing or into a new directory, after you select that, you can choose the `Shiny Web Application` option. The starting point is a runnable example that includes a histogram and a slider for selecting the amount of histogram bins.

Shiny apps can be divided into two parts -- the UI part (front end) and the server part (back end). The UI part includes all the visual elements and their layout, while the back end includes computations and visualizations.

## UI

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(

    # Application title
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)
        ),

        # Show a plot of the generated distribution
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)
```

## Server

```
# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
    })
}
```
